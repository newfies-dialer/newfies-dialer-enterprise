Call Detail Reports (CDR)
-------------------------

Call detail reports give the call records of each individual call along with a daily report. The UI only shows an overview of the CDR, to get a more detailed report, use the action button to download a report to CSV or Excel.

The report is mostly self explanatory, apart from the the duration and Bill Sec fields.

	- **Duration** is the amount of time from ringing to hangup.
	- **Bill-Sec** is the amount of time from answer to hangup - the sum of calls and duration should closely match your carrier's CDR.

Therefore it follows that Duration less Bill-Sec is the time the the phone rings for before it is answered.
