.. _dialer_tab:

Dialer Tab
----------

The dialer section controls the call in progress:

    - **A-Leg Gateway** - the gateway to use.
    - **Frequency** - Calls dispatched per minute, this can be varied without stopping the campaign.
    - **Max Call duration** - Make sure this is long enough to include the B-Leg where applicable.
    - **Max retries** - Try again if the call has failed (unobtainbable / congestion / No answer )
    - **Time between retries** - How long to wait before calling again.
    - **Timeout on Dialling** - how long to ring for before giving up (minimum 15 seconds)
    - **Dialer completion retries** - where the contact has not completed the survey, they can be called back. This is controlled by the Conpleted setting in the survey node.

.. _voicemail settings_tab:

Voicemail Settings
------------------

If AMD is not installed, you will not see this tab.

    :width: 800

There are three options.

    - **Always play message** - play the message to a contact, or if a machine, play the voice file selected in the voicemail audio file. The Audio file should be longer than the welcome message on an answering machine, for instance about 20+ seconds.
    - **Play message to human only** - Hangup when machine is detected.
    - **Leave message to voicemail only** - Hangup if person is detected, if machine, play the voicemail audio file. Note that this message should be longer than the voicemail greeting message (20+ secs)

.. _schedule_tab:

Schedule
--------

Decide which time of day to start and stop the campaigns, as well as which days they are active. By default, the campaign is set to start at the time of creation and finish 24 hours later.

.. image:: ../_static/images/customer/add_campaign_schedule.png
    :width: 800

It is good practice to set the days and times that a campaign should be active to ensure that calls are not made out of hours.

Note that retries do not respect the stop time, so sufficient time must be given for these to complete before the campaign stops.

.. _extra_tab:

Extra
-----

The only setting here for the moment is to opt to record the B-Leg, that is to say the call with the agent.

.. _list_campaigns:

List Campaigns
--------------

When a campaign is first created, the "Type" will show Survey Template, and the number of contacts will be 0. When the play button is pressed, the the "Type" will change to Survey and the number of contacts will be displayed.

.. image:: ../_static/images/customer/campaign_list.png

During the campaign, the speed of the campaign can be varied without having to stop the campaign. 

When the campaign is started, a snapshot is taken of the survey at that time, so if there is a mistake in the survey, and you edit it, a new campaign will have to be created ton include your edit.

There is also the option to copy a campaign. When a campaign is copied, it will use the snpashot described in the previous paragraph, so if you edit the a survey, then copy an existing campaign, the survey edits will not be included.

In brief, if you edit a survey, make a new campaign.

While the survey is in a state of "Started" then new contacts can be added to the phonebook and they will be called. This will not occur if the campaign is stopped, even if the campaign is later restarted.
