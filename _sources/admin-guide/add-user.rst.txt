Newfies-Dialer is multi-tenant, so each user or "Manager", as it is referred to in Newfies-Dialer can run their own campaigns isolated from every other manager on Newfies-Dialer.

The dialer settings are assigned to each manager, and these control the resources that a manager can consume.

Additionally, a voice and SMS (if applicable) gateway is assigned to the Manager, so they can only use the gateway(s) they are assigned.
