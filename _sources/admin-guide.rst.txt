When a Newfies-Dialer system is first commissioned, much of this work will be done as part of the commissioning process by the Newfies-Dialer team. However, it may be necessary for Newfies-Dialer admin to add new gateways or make other changes to the system.

The commissioning process will include:

* **Freeswitch/VoIP configuration** - setting up the VoIP gateways (carriers)
* **Text to speech**  - configuring TTS engines
* **SMS configuration** - settings up the SMS providers

Tasks which will be performed by Newfies-Dialer admin, with our training, will include:

* Adding new users
* Creating Dialer settings, which control the resources any one user can consume
