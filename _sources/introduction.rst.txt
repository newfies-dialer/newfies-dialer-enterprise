phonebooks, contacts, build audio messages and create complex telephony
applications for voice broadcasting.

third-party applications. Virtually every feature on the UI can be managed
via the API's.

Utility
--------
Newfies-Dialer is loaded up with a list of telephone numbers that can be dialled
sequentially at very high rates of calling depending on carrier capacity and
hardware, potentially delivering many millions of calls per day.

When the called party answers the call, Newfies-Dialer passes the call to a telephony
application that is custom designed to provide the desired behaviour.

* **Lead Generation**: Broadcast messages to contacts with a press one facility to transfer calls to a callcentre.

* **Telecasting**: Broadcast marketing or informational messages to customers and clients.

* **Phone Polling, Surveys and Voting**: Ring large numbers of people and present
  IVR options for either polling their opinions, interactive surveys, or taking
  their vote and record the results.

* **Debt Control**: Customers can be automatically reminded at intervals that
  they owe money, and an IVR menu presented to talk to the finance department
  or passed to a credit card capture IVR to pay over the phone.

* **Dissemination of information via phone**: Newfies-Dialer was originally
  designed to call large numbers of people and disseminate medical and health advice
  via cellphone in 3rd world countries where often, literacy levels are low. On a
  local scale, it can be used to disseminate information about forthcoming community events.

* **Mass Emergency broadcast**: Where there is a necessity to warn large numbers
  of people in a short space of time, such as weather warnings, evacuation notices
  and crime prevention.

* **Subscription Reminders and Renewals**: Where a company sells an annual
  subscription for a product or service, Newfies-Dialer can be configured to
  dial the customer, remind them that the subscription is due.
