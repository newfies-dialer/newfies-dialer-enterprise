.. _webhook:

=======
Webhook
=======

A webhook can be configured in order to push CDRs to your own platform or API endpoint. When a new CDR is created on our system, a POST request will be sent with the CDR details.
This is used when you either need to keep information about the call being made or to activate an application after a dial or an inbound call is made.

The Webhook comes with a UI on the admin, https://HOSTNAME/admin/webhook/webhookcdr/ and it has a retry mechanism, which ensures that CDRs are pushed correctly.
If there is an error, for instance your endpoint didn't accept the API call, it will be displayed on the UI.
